# Boomy Editor - Dance Central 3 Song Editor

## Project Overview

A comprehensive Electron-based editor for Dance Central 3 song files with timeline editing, move choreography, and camera shot management.

## Architecture Summary

### Core Technologies

- **Electron + React + TypeScript**: Main application framework
- **Zustand**: State management for songs and timeline
- **Tone.js**: Audio processing and MIDI handling
- **shadcn/ui**: UI component library
- **Vite**: Build tooling with automatic JSX runtime

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Secure IPC Architecture

- **Preload Script** (`src/preload.ts`): Secure bridge between main and renderer
- **IPC Handlers** (`src/main/ipcHandlers.ts`): File system operations in main process
- **APIs Available**: File read/write, directory operations, JSON parsing, external URLs

#### 2. State Management

- **Song Store** (`src/store/songStore.ts`):
  - Song CRUD operations
  - Move library management
  - Timeline data for easy/medium/expert difficulties
  - Auto-save functionality
- **Timeline Store** (`src/store/timelineStore.ts`):
  - Audio/MIDI integration with Tone.js
  - Playback controls and timeline navigation
  - Measure-based editing with BPM sync

#### 3. Type System

- **Song Types** (`src/types/song.d.ts`):
  - Move, MoveEvent, CameraEvent interfaces
  - Timeline structure for all difficulty levels
  - Move library integration types
- **Timeline Types** (`src/types/timeline.d.ts`):
  - Audio/MIDI data structures
  - Track and event management
  - Playback and viewport state

#### 4. Move Library System

- **Move Library Browser** (`src/app/MoveLibrary.tsx`):
  - CAT > SONG > MOVE folder structure navigation
  - JSON move file parsing and preview
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Import moves to timeline

#### 5. Timeline Editor

- **Main Timeline** (`src/app/timeline/TimelineEditor.tsx`):
  - Professional DAW-style interface
  - Transport controls (play/pause/stop/seek)
  - Difficulty selection (Easy/Medium/Expert)
  - Track type switching (Moves/Cameras)
  - Zoom controls and time display
- **Timeline Ruler** (`src/app/timeline/TimelineRuler.tsx`):
  - Measure and beat markers
  - Time scale display
  - Click-to-seek functionality
- **Timeline Tracks** (`src/app/timeline/TimelineTracks.tsx`):
  - Visual event representation
  - Beat-based event positioning
  - Move and camera event rendering
- **Track List** (`src/app/timeline/TrackList.tsx`):
  - Track properties and statistics
  - Event count and range display
  - Track visibility controls

#### 6. Editor Workspace

- **Main Workspace** (`src/app/EditorWorkspace.tsx`):
  - Tabbed interface with sidebar
  - Move Library, Choreography, and Camera tabs
  - Song information header
  - Integrated timeline editor

```

## Data Flow

1. **Song Loading**: User selects song folder → IPC reads files → Song store populated
2. **Move Library**: User browses CAT/SONG/MOVE structure → JSON files parsed → Moves imported
3. **Timeline Editing**: Audio/MIDI loaded via Tone.js → Playback controls → Visual timeline
4. **Event Management**: Click timeline → Add move/camera events → Auto-save to disk

## Key Accomplishments

✅ **Complete Electron Setup**: Security-focused IPC architecture
✅ **Professional Timeline**: DAW-style editor with transport controls
✅ **Move Library Integration**: Full CAT > SONG > MOVE navigation
✅ **Multi-Difficulty Support**: Easy/Medium/Expert timeline editing
✅ **Audio/MIDI Integration**: Tone.js-powered playback and sync
✅ **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
✅ **State Management**: Zustand stores with proper immutability
✅ **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable UI components

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Drag & Drop**: Implement move dragging from library to timeline
2. **Undo/Redo**: Add command pattern for timeline operations
3. **Export System**: Generate Dance Central 3 compatible files
4. **Performance**: Optimize large timeline rendering
5. **Testing**: Add unit tests for core functionality
6. **Packaging**: Electron Forge distribution setup

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development
npm start

# Build for production
npm run make

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

The editor provides a comprehensive foundation for Dance Central 3 song editing with professional-grade timeline editing capabilities, move library management, and secure file operations.
